# Project Orchestrator Wizard

## Overview
Final orchestration wizard that coordinates all project creation components, generates comprehensive implementation prompts, and creates a self-contained project ready for development.

## Phase 1: Project Creation Workflow

### Complete Workflow Orchestration
```
Project Creation Sequence:
1. Enhanced PRD Creation ‚Üí Comprehensive project requirements
2. Master Task Analysis ‚Üí High-level task briefs with goals and constraints
3. Conditional Capture Sessions:
   - Technology Selection (if technical decisions needed)
   - Security Planning (if security requirements detected)
   - Architecture Planning (if architectural decisions needed)
4. Final Task Brief Enhancement ‚Üí Context-rich implementation guidance
5. Implementation Prompt Generation ‚Üí Self-contained project ready for development
```

### Intelligent Workflow Management
**Based on PRD analysis, determine required capture sessions:**

```
