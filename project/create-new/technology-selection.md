- Low operational complexity
- Free or low-cost options
- Good documentation and community support

**Example Recommendations:**
- Frontend: React + Vite (modern, widely used, great learning value)
- Backend: Node.js + Express (JavaScript continuity, simple deployment)
- Database: PostgreSQL (robust, free, excellent learning platform)
- Hosting: Vercel/Netlify + Railway/Heroku (simple deployment, free tiers)

#### For Startup/Business Projects
**Prioritise:**
- Rapid development and iteration capability
- Scalability potential without premature optimisation
- Team hiring and expertise availability
- Operational costs and maintenance

**Example Recommendations:**
- Frontend: React/Vue.js + TypeScript (team scalability, maintainability)
- Backend: Node.js/Python/Go (based on team expertise and performance needs)
- Database: PostgreSQL + Redis (proven scalability, comprehensive features)
- Infrastructure: AWS/GCP (comprehensive services, scaling potential)

#### For POC/Prototype Projects
**Prioritise:**
- Speed of development over optimisation
- Familiar technologies to reduce learning overhead
- Simple deployment and sharing
- Easy iteration and modification

**Example Recommendations:**
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript or familiar framework
- Backend: Express.js/Flask/Rails (rapid development frameworks)
- Database: SQLite/PostgreSQL (simple setup, easy migration later)
- Hosting: GitHub Pages/Vercel (immediate deployment)

## Phase 4: Technology Decision Presentation

### Decision Format with Reasoning
```
"Based on your PRD analysis, here are my technology recommendations:

üéØ FRONTEND: React + TypeScript + Vite
   Reasoning: Your PRD mentions complex user interactions and data management
   Constraints: Mobile-responsive design, UK accessibility standards
   Implementation Notes: Focus on component reusability, modern React patterns

üîß BACKEND: Node.js + Express + TypeScript  
   Reasoning: API requirements and real-time features detected
   Constraints: Secure authentication, GDPR compliance for UK users
   Implementation Notes: RESTful API design, proper error handling

üíæ DATABASE: PostgreSQL + Redis
   Reasoning: Complex data relationships and performance requirements
   Constraints: Data protection compliance, backup and recovery capability
   Implementation Notes: Proper indexing, connection pooling

‚òÅÔ∏è INFRASTRUCTURE: Railway + Cloudflare
   Reasoning: Simple deployment with professional features
   Constraints: UK/EU data residency for GDPR compliance
   Implementation Notes: Environment variable management, monitoring setup

Alternative approaches considered:
- Next.js fullstack (simpler but less flexible for your API needs)
- Python/Django (excellent but team JavaScript expertise prioritised)
- MongoDB (document flexibility but relational data structure better fits your requirements)

Would you like to discuss any of these recommendations or explore alternatives?"
```

## Phase 5: Technology Constraint Integration

### Enhance Task Briefs with Technology Context
**Update existing task briefs with technology-specific constraints:**

**Original Task Brief:**
```
Task 1: Implement Core User Features
Goal: Enable users to perform primary actions identified in PRD
Constraints: UK English throughout, intuitive UX, mobile-responsive design
Research Areas: UI framework selection, user experience patterns
```

**Enhanced with Technology Context:**
```
Task 1: Implement Core User Features
Goal: Enable users to perform primary actions identified in PRD
Constraints: UK English throughout, intuitive UX, mobile-responsive design
Technology Context: React + TypeScript, Material-UI component library
Research Areas: React component patterns, accessibility with Material-UI
Implementation Notes: Focus on reusable components, proper TypeScript typing
```

### Technology-Specific Research Areas
**Add to task briefs:**
- Specific framework patterns and best practices
- Security considerations for chosen technologies
- Performance optimisation approaches
- Testing strategies appropriate for tech stack
- Deployment and operational considerations

## Phase 6: Implementation Guidance Generation

### Technology Setup Instructions
**Create technology-specific setup guidance:**

#### Development Environment Setup
- Required development tools and versions
- Project initialisation commands
- Development server configuration
- Environment variable template

#### Project Structure Recommendations
- Directory organisation patterns for chosen stack
- Configuration file templates
- Development workflow recommendations

### Technology Migration Considerations
**For each technology choice, document:**
- When to consider migrating to alternatives
- What indicators suggest current choice isn't working
- How to plan migration if needed
- Cost and complexity estimates for changes

## Integration with Master Task Analysis

### Task Brief Enhancement
- Add technology-specific constraints to existing task briefs
- Include implementation approach guidance
- Specify research areas with technology context
- Update dependencies based on technology architecture

### New Technology-Specific Task Briefs
**May generate additional task briefs:**

## Output Deliverables

1. **Technology Recommendations Document**: Comprehensive technology choices with reasoning
2. **Enhanced Task Briefs**: Updated with technology-specific context and constraints
3. **Setup Instructions**: Technology-specific development environment guidance
4. **Architecture Overview**: How chosen technologies integrate and communicate
5. **Migration Planning**: Future-proofing and technology evolution considerations

## Meta-Documentation

This Technology Selection wizard balances:
- **Informed recommendations** based on project requirements and current best practices
- **Flexibility for implementation** without over-specifying technical details
- **Context enhancement** of existing task briefs rather than replacement
- **Future adaptability** through decision documentation and migration planning

The key innovation is technology choice integration with existing planning documents rather than creating separate technical specifications that might conflict with project evolution.
