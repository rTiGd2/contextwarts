- Event-driven or API-centric functionality

**Architecture Characteristics:**
```
Architecture Pattern: Serverless with Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)
Reasoning: Variable load and operational simplicity favour serverless approach
Implementation Approach:
- Function-based backend implementation
- Managed database and authentication services
- Static frontend with API integration
- Event-driven function orchestration

Technology Integration: [Based on chosen stack]

```

## Phase 3: Architecture Decision Presentation

### Decision Presentation with Trade-offs
```
"Based on your PRD analysis, technology selections, and team context, here's my architecture recommendation:

üèóÔ∏è RECOMMENDED: Modular Monolith Architecture
   Reasoning: Team size (2-3 people), moderate complexity, rapid development needs
   Benefits: Simple deployment, fast development, easy debugging and testing
   Trade-offs: Scaling requires more planning, technology stack lock-in initially
   
   Implementation Approach:
   - Clear module boundaries (User Management, Core Features, External Integrations)
   - Layered architecture (Presentation ‚Üí Business Logic ‚Üí Data Access)
   - Single database with logical separation
   - Simple CI/CD with single deployment artifact

Alternative architectures considered:
   
‚ö° Microservices: Excellent for scaling teams, but operational overhead too high for current team size
üí´ Event-Driven: Perfect for real-time features, but adds complexity not justified by current requirements
‚òÅÔ∏è Serverless: Great for cost optimisation, but vendor lock-in concerns for business-critical application

Evolution Path:
Your chosen architecture can evolve as requirements change:
- Module boundaries prepare for future service extraction
- Database design allows for service-per-database migration
- API design enables frontend/backend separation when needed

Would you like to discuss this recommendation or explore alternative approaches?"

## Phase 7: Architecture Documentation and Guidelines

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
```markdown
# Architecture Decision Record: ADR-001 - Application Architecture Pattern

## Status: Accepted
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Decision Makers:** [Team/Stakeholder Names]

## Context
We need to choose an application architecture pattern that supports:
- Team size of 2-3 developers with potential for growth
- Moderate complexity requirements with integration needs
- Rapid development and deployment requirements
- Future evolution as requirements and team grow

## Decision
We will implement a Modular Monolith architecture pattern.

## Rationale
- Team size favours simple deployment and debugging
- Module boundaries prepare for future service extraction
- Technology stack choice supports this pattern well
- Development speed prioritised over distributed system benefits

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Faster initial development and deployment
- Easier debugging and testing
- Simple operational model
- Clear module boundaries support code organisation

**Negative:**
- Scaling requires more planning than microservices
- Technology stack changes affect entire application
- Module discipline required to maintain boundaries

## Evolution Strategy
Module boundaries designed to support future service extraction when team size and requirements justify distributed architecture.
