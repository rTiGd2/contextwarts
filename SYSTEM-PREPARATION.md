# Pattern-Based Project Wizard - System Preparation Guide

## Project Creator Credits

**Created by**: **Tig Campbell-Moore**  
**GitHub**: **rTiGd2**  
**Project**: Revolutionary Pattern-Based Project Development System  
**Innovation**: Transformed traditional one-time project wizards into continuous pattern-driven development enablement platform  

**GitHub Repository**: [contextwarts](https://github.com/rTiGd2/contextwarts) *(pending repository creation)*

---

## System Overview

This revolutionary pattern-based wizard system transforms project development from one-time setup to continuous evolution through:

- **Pattern-Driven Architecture**: Composable patterns for creation, enhancement, gap-filling, and upgrade modes
- **AI Development Integration**: Complete offline context generation for AI-assisted development
- **Methodology Integration**: Comprehensive development methodology patterns (TDD, BDD, DDD, ATDD, EDD)
- **Self-Sufficient Framework**: Projects continue evolving without wizard dependency
- **Pattern Adherence Validation**: Automated quality and consistency maintenance

---

## Cleanup Requirements

### Orphaned Files from Track-to-Pattern Refactor

**Files to Remove:**
```bash
# Remove old track-based system
rm -rf .claude-system/tracks/
rm -rf .claude-system/wizards/pattern-application-wizard.md

# These have been replaced by the pattern system in:
# - .claude-system/patterns/ (new pattern structure)
# - .claude-system/core/ (pattern engine and systems)
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ All track functionality migrated to pattern system
- ✅ Pattern system provides superior capabilities  
- ✅ No functionality loss in removal

---

## Proposed Project Name

### **"PatternForge"**

**Tagline**: *"Forge continuous evolution through intelligent patterns"*

**Alternative Names:**
- **WizardForge**: Emphasizes the wizard transformation aspect
- **PatternCraft**: Highlights the crafting/creation aspect
- **DevForge**: Broader development focus
- **ArchitectFlow**: Emphasizes architecture and workflow

**Reasoning for PatternForge:**
- **"Pattern"**: Core concept of the system
- **"Forge"**: Implies continuous creation, refinement, and strengthening
- **Memorable**: Easy to remember and type
- **Professional**: Suitable for enterprise and individual use
- **Extensible**: Works for future pattern categories

## Directory Structure Recommendation

### Current `.claude-system` Analysis
The `.claude-system` directory name was created for development context but should be renamed for public deployment:

**Recommended Structure:**
```
contextwarts/                    # Main system directory
├── core/                       # Pattern engine and core systems
├── patterns/                   # Pattern library
│   ├── technology/
│   ├── architecture/
│   ├── security/
│   ├── infrastructure/
│   └── methodology/
├── templates/                  # Code and configuration templates
├── docs/                      # Documentation and guides
├── install/                   # Installation and setup scripts
└── examples/                  # Example implementations
```

**Installation Location Options:**
1. **User Global**: `~/.patternforge/` (recommended for individual users)
2. **System Global**: `/usr/local/share/patternforge/` (for system-wide installation)
3. **Project Local**: `.patternforge/` (for project-specific customizations)

## Claude Code Integration

### `/wizard` Command Implementation

**Installation Method 1: Claude Code Settings**
```json
// In Claude Code settings.json
{
  "commands": {
    "/wizard": {
      "description": "Launch PatternForge wizard for pattern-based project development", 
      "prompt": "You are the PatternForge wizard assistant. Load the PatternForge system from ~/.patternforge/ and help the user with pattern-based project development. Start by reading ~/.patternforge/core/pattern-engine.md to understand the pattern system, then assess whether this is a new project creation, existing project enhancement, gap filling, or pattern upgrade scenario. Provide context-aware pattern recommendations and guide the user through the implementation process.",
      "system_requirements": "~/.patternforge/ directory must be installed"
    }
  }
}
```

**Installation Method 2: Claude Code Extension** *(Future development)*
- Create Claude Code extension package  
- Automatic system installation and management
- Integrated pattern selection UI
- Progress tracking and validation

## Deployment Prompt

### AI Installation Assistant Prompt
```markdown
You are the PatternForge installation assistant. Help the user install and configure the PatternForge pattern-based wizard system.

**Your Tasks:**
1. **System Installation**:
   - Detect user's operating system (Windows/macOS/Linux)
   - Guide through PatternForge system installation to appropriate directory
   - Verify installation completeness and system requirements

2. **Claude Code Integration**:
   - Help configure `/wizard` command in Claude Code settings
   - Verify command functionality and system integration
   - Provide troubleshooting for common issues

3. **System Validation**:
   - Test pattern engine functionality
   - Verify pattern library completeness  
   - Validate AI context generation capabilities

4. **Quick Start Guidance**:
   - Demonstrate basic wizard usage
   - Show pattern selection and application
   - Guide through first project creation or enhancement

**Installation Process:**

**Step 1: Download and Install**
```bash
# Option A: Direct installation (recommended)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rTiGd2/pattern-based-wizard/main/install/install.sh | bash

# Option B: Manual installation
git clone https://github.com/rTiGd2/pattern-based-wizard.git
cd pattern-based-wizard
./install/install.sh

# Option C: Python installer (cross-platform)
pip install patternforge-wizard
patternforge-wizard install
```

**Step 2: Claude Code Configuration**
```json
# Add to Claude Code settings.json:
{
  "commands": {
    "/wizard": {
      "description": "Launch PatternForge pattern-based project wizard",
      "prompt": "Load PatternForge system and assist with pattern-based development..."
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Verification**
```bash
# Test installation
patternforge-wizard --version
patternforge-wizard validate-installation

# Test Claude Code integration
# In Claude Code, type: /wizard
```

**Common Issues:**
- **Permission Errors**: Use `sudo` for system-wide installation or install to user directory
- **Path Issues**: Ensure `~/.patternforge/` or installation directory is accessible
- **Claude Code Integration**: Verify settings.json syntax and restart Claude Code
- **Missing Dependencies**: Install required system dependencies (git, curl, python)

**After Installation:**
- Your system now has access to 50+ patterns across technology, architecture, security, infrastructure, and methodology categories
- Use `/wizard` in Claude Code for AI-guided pattern application
- Pattern-based projects will automatically include AI development context
- System supports continuous project evolution through pattern application modes
