# Bootstrap Documentation: How This System Was Created

## Genesis

This .claude-system was created during a conversation where we evolved from:
1. Manual project assessment → Systematic improvement approach
2. Single-use prompts → Reusable wizard domains  
3. Ad-hoc documentation → Self-documenting recursive system

## Bootstrap Problem & Solution

**The Problem**: How do you document how to create the wizard system itself?

**The Solution**: 
- This BOOTSTRAP.md documents the initial creation
- The wizard domain documents how to extend and improve the system
- Each domain documents how it was created using the wizard creation methodology

## Initial System Creation Process

### Step 1: Core Foundation
Created `core/` directory with fundamental principles:
- `master-rules.md` - Q&A methodology, research-first approach
- `session-management.md` - Context boundaries and /clear protocols  
- `context-loading.md` - How domains load minimal required context

### Step 2: Domain Structure
Created domain-based architecture:
- `project/` - Project analysis, creation, improvement
- `development/` - Code review, architecture, debugging, refactoring
- `business/` - PRD creation, market analysis, funding strategy
- `operations/` - Deployment, monitoring, security, disaster recovery
- `learning/` - Research, skill development, knowledge synthesis
- `wizard/` - Meta-system for managing the wizard system itself

### Step 3: Command Structure
Implemented nested command pattern:
- `/wizard <domain> <action>` for domain-specific actions
- `/wizard <domain> help` for domain documentation
- `/wizard wizard` for system self-management

### Step 4: Recursive Self-Documentation
Each wizard documents:
- How it was created
- What methodology was used  
- How to improve or extend it
- How improvements propagate to similar wizards

## Key Design Decisions

### Domain-Based Organization
- Each top-level directory = specialized context domain
- Prevents command namespace conflicts
- Enables focused expertise development
- Supports independent domain evolution

### Self-Improving Architecture
- Wizard domain can modify other domains
- Improvements automatically propagate
- System documents its own evolution
- Bootstrap problem solved through layered documentation

### Context Management
- Minimal context loading per domain
- Clear session boundaries with /clear
- Self-contained domain operation
- Explicit context handoff protocols

## Recursive Enhancement Protocol

When the wizard domain creates improvements:

1. **Document the enhancement** in wizard domain help
2. **Identify affected domains** that could benefit
3. **Update existing implementations** systematically
4. **Propagate methodology improvements** to creation templates
5. **Update this bootstrap documentation** to reflect evolution

## Command Examples From Genesis

The conversation that created this system included commands like:
- Analysis of existing .claude prompt files
- Recognition of sophisticated PRD creation system  
- Evolution to systematic improvement approach
- Design of recursive wizard creation methodology

## Future Evolution

This system should evolve through:
- **Discovery**: New patterns found through usage
- **Enhancement**: Improvements to existing domains
- **Extension**: New domains for emerging needs
- **Integration**: Better inter-domain cooperation

The wizard domain will manage this evolution systematically.
