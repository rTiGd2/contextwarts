# Task Management Integration for Contextwarts

## Purpose
Integrate the sophisticated task management methodology from generate-tasks.md and process-task-list.md into the Contextwarts wizard system, enabling structured task-driven development as a core capability.

---

## Core Task Management Philosophy

### From generate-tasks.md Insights:
1. **Two-Phase Task Generation**: High-level tasks â†’ User confirmation â†’ Detailed sub-tasks
2. **Context-Aware Analysis**: PRD analysis + Current codebase assessment + Pattern integration
3. **File Relevance Identification**: Automatic detection of files needing creation/modification
4. **Junior Developer Focus**: Clear, actionable guidance for less experienced developers

### From process-task-list.md Insights:
1. **Disciplined Execution**: One sub-task at a time with explicit permission protocols
2. **Quality Integration**: Test suite execution before parent task completion
3. **Git Workflow Integration**: Conventional commits with structured multi-line messages
4. **Living Documentation**: Task lists as maintained, current project documentation

---

## Wizard Commands Integration

### New Task-Related Commands

#### `/wizard generate-tasks [prd-file]`
**Purpose**: Generate structured task list from PRD using two-phase approach

**Process**:
```
1. Load PRD and analyze requirements
2. Assess current codebase and applied patterns
3. Generate 5-7 high-level parent tasks
4. Present to user: "High-level tasks generated. Ready for sub-tasks? Type 'Go' to proceed."
5. Wait for user confirmation
6. Generate detailed sub-tasks for each parent task
7. Identify relevant files (implementation + test files)
8. Create tasks-[prd-name].md in /tasks/ directory
```

#### `/wizard execute-tasks [task-file]`
**Purpose**: Execute tasks using disciplined protocol

**Process**:
```
1. Load task file and identify next incomplete sub-task
2. Present sub-task to user for confirmation
3. Guide implementation with pattern awareness
4. Mark sub-task complete when finished
5. Check if parent task is complete (all sub-tasks done)
6. If parent complete: run test suite â†’ git add â†’ clean up â†’ commit
7. Ask permission before starting next sub-task
```

#### `/wizard update-tasks [task-file]`
**Purpose**: Maintain task list as living documentation

**Process**:
```
1. Review current state vs task list
2. Mark completed tasks as [x]
3. Add newly discovered tasks
4. Update "Relevant Files" section
5. Sync with actual codebase state
```

## Task Generation Template Integration

### Enhanced Task Template
```markdown
# Tasks for [Feature Name]
*Generated from PRD: [prd-file-name].md*
*Applied Patterns: [list-of-relevant-patterns]*

## Pattern Integration Notes
- **Architecture Pattern**: [how architecture patterns affect implementation]
- **Security Considerations**: [security patterns to apply]
- **Testing Strategy**: [testing patterns and methodology integration]
- **Quality Gates**: [quality automation patterns]

## Relevant Files

### Implementation Files
- `path/to/component.tsx` - [Description] (Pattern: [relevant-pattern])
- `path/to/service.ts` - [Description] (Pattern: [relevant-pattern])
- `path/to/types.ts` - [Description] (Pattern: [relevant-pattern])

### Test Files  
- `path/to/component.test.tsx` - Unit tests for component
- `path/to/service.test.ts` - Service integration tests
- `path/to/e2e.test.ts` - End-to-end feature tests

### Configuration Files
- `path/to/config.json` - [Configuration purpose]
- `docs/feature-documentation.md` - Feature documentation

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 **[Parent Task Title]** (Estimated: [time])
  - [ ] 1.1 [Sub-task with pattern guidance] (Pattern: [pattern-name])
  - [ ] 1.2 [Sub-task with quality requirements]
  - [ ] 1.3 [Sub-task with testing requirements]
- [ ] 2.0 **[Parent Task Title]** (Estimated: [time])
  - [ ] 2.1 [Sub-task description]
  - [ ] 2.2 [Sub-task description]

## Completion Protocol

### Sub-task Completion:
1. Implement sub-task following applied patterns
2. Update task list: `[ ]` â†’ `[x]`
3. Request permission for next sub-task

### Parent Task Completion:
1. Verify all sub-tasks marked `[x]`
2. Run full test suite: `npm test` (or project equivalent)
3. Stage changes: `git add .`
4. Clean up temporary files and code
5. Commit with conventional format:
   ```
   git commit -m "feat: [parent task summary]" \
             -m "- [key change 1]" \
             -m "- [key change 2]" \
             -m "Task: [task-number] | PRD: [prd-reference]"
   ```
6. Mark parent task complete: `[ ]` â†’ `[x]`

## Pattern Adherence Validation
- [ ] Applied patterns validated against implementation
- [ ] Quality gates satisfied per methodology patterns  
- [ ] Testing requirements met per testing patterns
- [ ] Documentation updated per documentation patterns
```

## Wizard System Integration

### Pattern-Aware Task Generation

When generating tasks, the wizard will:

1. **Analyze Applied Patterns**: Consider all patterns in `.contextwarts/core/patterns-applied.yaml`
2. **Pattern-Specific Guidance**: Include pattern-specific implementation notes in sub-tasks
3. **Quality Integration**: Automatically include quality validation based on applied patterns
4. **Testing Strategy**: Align testing requirements with methodology patterns (TDD, BDD, etc.)

### Example Integration:
```
Sub-task: "Implement user authentication component"

Pattern Guidance:
- Architecture: Follow clean architecture pattern with dependency injection
- Security: Apply advanced-authentication pattern with WebAuthn support
- Testing: Use TDD approach - write tests first, then implementation
- Quality: Validate against security pattern checklist
```

### Context Loading for Task Execution

When executing tasks, the wizard will:

1. **Load Project Context**: Read `.contextwarts/standalone-context/project-resume-context.md`
2. **Pattern Awareness**: Apply pattern-specific implementation guidance
3. **Quality Gates**: Use methodology patterns to determine quality requirements
4. **Testing Integration**: Execute appropriate test suites based on applied patterns

---

## Task-Driven Development Pattern

### Core Principles:
1. **Hierarchical Decomposition**: Parent tasks â†’ Sub-tasks with clear ownership
2. **Disciplined Execution**: One sub-task at a time with permission protocols
3. **Quality Integration**: Test-driven completion with pattern validation
4. **Living Documentation**: Task lists as current project state representation
5. **Pattern Alignment**: All tasks respect and reinforce applied patterns

### Implementation Workflow:
```
/clear && /wizard generate-tasks prd-user-authentication.md
â†’ Generates tasks-prd-user-authentication.md with pattern integration

/clear && /wizard execute-tasks tasks-prd-user-authentication.md  
â†’ Starts disciplined task execution with pattern guidance

User works on sub-task 1.1 following pattern guidance
/wizard complete-subtask 1.1
â†’ Marks complete, asks permission for 1.2

All sub-tasks of Task 1.0 complete
/wizard complete-parent-task 1.0
â†’ Runs tests, commits with conventional format, marks parent complete
```
