# Pattern Adherence and Context Persistence System

## Purpose
Ensures that pattern implementations are adhered to over time and provides seamless context restoration for AI assistance, enabling developers to "hit the ground running" when returning to pattern-based projects.

---

## The Pattern Adherence Challenge

### Context Loss Problem
When developers apply patterns and then return to work later, they face several challenges:
- **Context Loss**: AI doesn't remember what patterns were chosen or why
- **Implementation Drift**: Code gradually deviates from pattern guidelines
- **Incomplete Pattern Application**: Patterns partially implemented then forgotten
- **Inconsistent Pattern Usage**: Different team members apply patterns differently

### The .aiwizard Directory Solution

The `.aiwizard` directory serves as the persistent context and adherence tracking system:

```
project-root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .aiwizard/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-context.yaml          # Core project context and decisions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ applied-patterns.yaml         # Applied patterns and their configurations
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pattern-adherence.yaml        # Adherence tracking and validation rules
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implementation-state.yaml     # Current implementation status
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ quality-metrics.yaml          # Quality and adherence metrics
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team-preferences.yaml         # Team-specific customizations
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session-history/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-01-30-pattern-application.yaml
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-02-15-enhancement-session.yaml
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-03-01-gap-analysis.yaml

## AI Context Loading System

### Quick Context Restoration

When a developer returns to work, they can invoke pattern context loading:

```bash
# Load full project context
/load-project-context

# Quick pattern status check
/pattern-status

# Resume specific pattern work
/resume-pattern test-driven-development

# Check pattern adherence
/check-adherence --pattern advanced-authentication
```

### Context Loading Workflow

#### Phase 1: Automatic Context Detection (10 seconds)
```python
class ProjectContextLoader:
    def load_project_context(self, project_path: str) -> ProjectContext:
        context = ProjectContext()
        
        # Load .aiwizard configuration
        aiwizard_path = os.path.join(project_path, '.aiwizard')
        if os.path.exists(aiwizard_path):
            context.load_from_aiwizard(aiwizard_path)
        
        # Validate current implementation against patterns
        context.validate_pattern_adherence()
        
        # Identify any drift or issues
        context.detect_pattern_drift()
        
        return context
```

#### Phase 2: Context Summary Presentation (Immediate)
```markdown
# Project Context Loaded: Food Intelligence Platform

## Applied Patterns (3 active)
‚úÖ **Modern Web Stack** (v1.0) - Complete, 95% adherence
‚ö†Ô∏è  **Advanced Authentication** (v1.0) - In Progress, 78% adherence  
üî¥ **Test-Driven Development** (v1.0) - Partial, 65% adherence

## Recent Changes Detected
- 15 commits since last pattern review
- New authentication endpoints added (good - following advanced-auth pattern)
- Tests missing for recent payment features (violates TDD pattern)
- Security headers partially implemented (auth pattern needs completion)

## Recommended Actions
1. **Priority**: Complete TDD adherence - add tests for payment features
2. **Security**: Finish CSP header implementation 
3. **Review**: Schedule pattern adherence review for Feb 13

Ready to continue development with pattern guidance?
```

#### Phase 3: Active Pattern Assistance
Once context is loaded, AI provides pattern-aware assistance:

```markdown
# Pattern-Aware Development Mode Active

## Current Context
- **Active Pattern**: Test-Driven Development
- **Current Feature**: Payment processing enhancement
- **Pattern Status**: Behind on test coverage

## TDD Guidance
Based on your TDD pattern configuration:
- **Next Step**: Write failing test for new payment validation
- **Cycle**: You're in RED phase (write failing test)
- **Reminder**: Refactor payment service - last refactor was 14 days ago

## Pattern Compliance
- Test coverage: 78% (target: 85%) - add 12 more tests
- Recent commits: 3 code-first commits detected (should be test-first)
- Refactoring needed: PaymentService complexity is high

Would you like me to help you write the failing test first (following TDD), or review pattern adherence issues?
```

## Pattern Drift Detection

### Automated Monitoring

#### File System Monitoring
```python
class PatternDriftDetector:
    def monitor_pattern_adherence(self, project_path: str, patterns: List[Pattern]):
        for pattern in patterns:
            # Check file structure adherence
            structure_compliance = self.check_file_structure(project_path, pattern)
            
            # Check code pattern adherence
            code_compliance = self.analyze_code_patterns(project_path, pattern)
            
            # Check configuration adherence
            config_compliance = self.validate_configuration(project_path, pattern)
            
            # Update adherence scores
            self.update_adherence_score(pattern, structure_compliance, code_compliance, config_compliance)
            
            # Generate recommendations
            if any(score < pattern.minimum_adherence_threshold for score in [structure_compliance, code_compliance, config_compliance]):
                self.generate_remediation_plan(pattern, project_path)
```

#### Git Hook Integration
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Pattern adherence pre-commit hook

echo "Checking pattern adherence..."

# Check TDD pattern compliance
if [ -f .aiwizard/applied-patterns.yaml ] && grep -q "test-driven-development" .aiwizard/applied-patterns.yaml; then
    # Verify this commit includes tests for new code
    python .aiwizard/scripts/check-tdd-compliance.py
fi

# Check other pattern adherences
python .aiwizard/scripts/pattern-adherence-check.py --pre-commit

echo "Pattern adherence check complete."
```

### Continuous Adherence Monitoring

#### Daily Adherence Reports
```yaml
# Generated daily adherence report
adherence_report:
  date: "2025-01-30"
  overall_score: 0.79
  
  pattern_scores:
    - pattern: "test-driven-development"
      score: 0.65
      trend: "declining"  # was 0.72 last week
      issues:
        - "3 commits without accompanying tests"
        - "PaymentService needs refactoring (complexity: 15, threshold: 10)"
        - "Test coverage dropped from 82% to 78%"
      recommendations:
        - "Schedule refactoring session"
        - "Add tests for recent payment features"
        - "Review TDD practices with team"
        
    - pattern: "advanced-authentication"  
      score: 0.78
      trend: "improving"  # was 0.65 last week
      issues:
        - "CSP headers not fully implemented"
        - "WebAuthn authentication flow incomplete"
      recommendations:
        - "Complete CSP header configuration"
        - "Finish WebAuthn authentication implementation"
```

### Onboarding New Team Members

#### Pattern Context Transfer
```markdown
# New Team Member Pattern Context

## Project Pattern Overview
This project uses 3 core patterns:

1. **Test-Driven Development** 
   - We write tests first, then code
   - Red-Green-Refactor cycle in ~5 minute cycles
   - Refactoring sessions every Friday afternoon
   - Current adherence: 65% (we're working on improving this)

2. **Advanced Authentication**
   - WebAuthn/passkeys + MFA + SSO
   - Implementation is 78% complete  
   - Focus: Complete CSP headers and WebAuthn auth flow

3. **Multi-Database Architecture**
   - PostgreSQL (main data) + Redis (cache) + SQLite (config)
   - Different databases for different use cases
   - 95% adherence - well implemented

## Your First Week
- Day 1: Review TDD practices with senior dev
- Day 2: Pair program on authentication features
- Day 3: Complete pattern adherence training
- Week 1 Goal: Make first test-first commit

## Pattern Resources
- TDD Guide: `.aiwizard/patterns/tdd-team-guide.md`
- Auth Implementation: `.aiwizard/patterns/auth-implementation-status.md`
- Team Practices: `.aiwizard/team-preferences.yaml`
```

This Pattern Adherence and Context Persistence System ensures that pattern implementations are maintained over time and that AI assistance remains contextually relevant and immediately useful when developers return to pattern-based projects.

The `.aiwizard` directory becomes the "project memory" that enables both human developers and AI assistants to maintain consistency and continuously improve pattern adherence throughout the project lifecycle.
