### `/wizard help context-management`
```
üß† Context Management Best Practices

For optimal Contextwarts performance and accuracy, follow these context management guidelines:

BEFORE WIZARD COMMANDS:
  /clear                              - Clear context before any wizard operation
  
  Why: Contextwarts loads extensive pattern libraries and project analysis. 
  Clean context ensures:
  ‚Ä¢ Faster loading and processing
  ‚Ä¢ More accurate pattern recommendations  
  ‚Ä¢ Reduced context confusion between different projects
  ‚Ä¢ Optimal AI assistant performance

RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW:
  /clear && /wizard [command]         - One-line context clearing + command
  
  Examples:
  /clear && /wizard create startup web-app
  /clear && /wizard enhance authentication
  /clear && /wizard generate-tasks prd-file.md

CONTEXT LOADING COMMANDS (No /clear needed):
  /wizard help                        - Help commands don't need context clearing
  /wizard load-context               - Explicitly loads project context
  /wizard info [pattern-name]        - Pattern info commands

WHEN TO ALWAYS USE /clear:
  ‚Ä¢ Switching between different projects
  ‚Ä¢ Starting any pattern application workflow
  ‚Ä¢ Generating tasks from PRD
  ‚Ä¢ Beginning any major wizard operation
  ‚Ä¢ When AI responses seem confused or irrelevant

PERFORMANCE BENEFITS:
  ‚Ä¢ 3-5x faster wizard command processing
  ‚Ä¢ More accurate pattern detection and recommendations
  ‚Ä¢ Reduced memory usage during complex operations
  ‚Ä¢ Better AI assistant response quality
```

### `/wizard help troubleshooting`
```
üîß PatternForge Troubleshooting

COMMON ISSUES:

‚ùå "Pattern not found"
  ‚Ä¢ Check pattern name spelling: /wizard list [category]
  ‚Ä¢ Verify pattern exists: /wizard info [pattern-name]
  ‚Ä¢ Update pattern library: /wizard update

‚ùå "Context not found" 
  ‚Ä¢ Ensure .aiwizard directory exists in project root
  ‚Ä¢ Run: /wizard load-context to regenerate
  ‚Ä¢ Check file permissions on .aiwizard directory

‚ùå "Pattern conflict detected"
  ‚Ä¢ Review conflict resolution: /wizard info [conflicting-pattern]
  ‚Ä¢ Use upgrade mode: /wizard upgrade [old-pattern] to [new-pattern]
  ‚Ä¢ Manual resolution: /wizard resolve-conflict [pattern1] [pattern2]

‚ùå "Validation failed"
  ‚Ä¢ Check specific validation errors: /wizard validate patterns --verbose
  ‚Ä¢ Review pattern implementation: /wizard info [failing-pattern]
  ‚Ä¢ Update implementation: /wizard refresh-pattern [pattern-name]

‚ùå "Installation issues"
  ‚Ä¢ Verify installation: /wizard --version
  ‚Ä¢ Check permissions: ensure ~/.patternforge/ is accessible
  ‚Ä¢ Reinstall: See GitHub installation guide

### `/wizard help task-management`
```
üìã Task-Driven Development Integration

Contextwarts includes sophisticated task management capabilities for structured development.

TASK GENERATION FROM PRD:
  /wizard generate-tasks [prd-file]     - Generate pattern-aware task list from PRD
  
  Process:
  1. Analyze PRD + Current codebase + Applied patterns
  2. Generate 5-7 high-level parent tasks
  3. Wait for user confirmation: "Ready for sub-tasks? Type 'Go'"
  4. Generate detailed sub-tasks with pattern guidance
  5. Identify relevant files (implementation + tests)
  6. Create tasks-[prd-name].md in /tasks/ directory

DISCIPLINED TASK EXECUTION:
  /wizard execute-tasks [task-file]     - Execute tasks with quality gates
  
  Protocol:
  1. Load next incomplete sub-task
  2. Request user permission to proceed
  3. Provide pattern-specific implementation guidance
  4. Mark sub-task complete when finished
  5. For parent task completion: Run tests ‚Üí Git add ‚Üí Clean ‚Üí Commit
  6. Request permission before starting next sub-task

TASK MAINTENANCE:
  /wizard update-tasks [task-file]      - Maintain task list as living documentation
  
  Updates:
  ‚Ä¢ Mark completed tasks as [x]
  ‚Ä¢ Add newly discovered tasks
  ‚Ä¢ Update "Relevant Files" section
  ‚Ä¢ Sync with actual codebase state

FEATURES:
  ‚Ä¢ Two-phase generation with user confirmation
  ‚Ä¢ Pattern-aware sub-task guidance
  ‚Ä¢ Hierarchical parent-child task relationships
  ‚Ä¢ Quality integration with test suite execution
  ‚Ä¢ Git workflow integration with conventional commits
  ‚Ä¢ File relevance identification and tracking
  ‚Ä¢ Junior developer friendly with detailed guidance

COMPLETION PROTOCOL:
  Sub-task: Implement ‚Üí Mark [x] ‚Üí Request permission
  Parent task: All sub-tasks [x] ‚Üí Run tests ‚Üí Git commit ‚Üí Mark [x]

QUALITY GATES:
  ‚Ä¢ All tests must pass before parent task completion
  ‚Ä¢ Pattern adherence validation
  ‚Ä¢ Conventional commit format with detailed messages
  ‚Ä¢ Clean code - no temporary files or debug code
```
