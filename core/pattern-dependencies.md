# Pattern Dependencies and Conflict Resolution

## Purpose
Manages complex relationships between patterns, ensuring proper application order, resolving conflicts, and maintaining system coherence across all application modes.

---

## Dependency Types

### 1. Required Dependencies
**Definition**: Patterns that MUST be present before this pattern can be applied
**Behavior**: Automatically applied if missing, or application blocked until resolved

```yaml
# Example: Advanced Authentication Pattern
dependencies:
  required:
    - pattern: "basic-https"
      reason: "HTTPS required for secure token transmission"
      auto_apply: true
      
    - pattern: "session-management" 
      reason: "Session handling required for authentication flows"
      auto_apply: true
      
    - pattern: "user-data-storage"
      reason: "User credentials and profile storage required"
      auto_apply: false  # Requires user choice of storage pattern
```

### 2. Optional Dependencies
**Definition**: Patterns that enhance functionality but aren't required
**Behavior**: Suggest during application, can be applied later

```yaml
dependencies:
  optional:
    - pattern: "database-integration"
      reason: "Recommended for user profile storage and audit logging"
      benefit: "Persistent user data and comprehensive audit trails"
      
    - pattern: "rate-limiting"
      reason: "Protects authentication endpoints from abuse"
      benefit: "Prevents brute force and denial of service attacks"
```

### 3. Contextual Dependencies
**Definition**: Dependencies that vary based on context
**Behavior**: Applied based on detected context or user requirements

```yaml
dependencies:
  contextual:
    - condition: "user_base > 1000"
      pattern: "rate-limiting"
      reason: "Large user base requires protection against abuse"
      
    - condition: "compliance_required"
      pattern: "audit-logging"
      reason: "Compliance regulations require comprehensive audit trails"
      
    - condition: "enterprise_environment"
      pattern: "sso-integration"
      reason: "Enterprise users expect single sign-on capabilities"
```

## Conflict Resolution

### 1. Direct Conflicts
**Definition**: Patterns that cannot coexist
**Resolution**: Replacement, upgrade, or user choice

```yaml
conflicts:
  direct:
    - pattern: "basic-authentication"
      resolution: "replace"
      message: "Advanced authentication replaces basic password authentication"
      migration_path: "patterns/security/auth-migration.md"
      
    - pattern: "no-auth-pattern"
      resolution: "replace"
      message: "Authentication pattern replaces anonymous access"
      breaking_change: true
```

### 2. Soft Conflicts
**Definition**: Patterns that can coexist but may cause issues
**Resolution**: Warning, configuration adjustment, or upgrade suggestion

```yaml
conflicts:
  soft:
    - pattern: "basic-session-management"
      resolution: "upgrade"
      message: "Consider upgrading to secure session management for better security"
      compatibility: true
      
    - pattern: "client-side-storage"
      resolution: "configure"
      message: "Ensure client storage doesn't conflict with secure token handling"
      adjustment: "Use secure storage options for authentication tokens"
```

### 3. Version Conflicts
**Definition**: Different versions of the same pattern family
**Resolution**: Version upgrade or downgrade

```yaml
conflicts:
  version:
    - pattern: "jwt-auth-v1"
      resolution: "upgrade"
      target_version: "v2"
      breaking_changes: false
      message: "Upgrading to JWT v2 for improved security features"
```

## Dependency Resolution Engine

### Algorithm Flow
```python
# Conceptual dependency resolution
class DependencyResolver:
    def resolve_dependencies(self, target_pattern: Pattern, context: ProjectContext) -> ResolutionPlan:
        plan = ResolutionPlan()
        
        # Step 1: Collect all dependencies
        dependencies = self.collect_dependencies(target_pattern, context)
        
        # Step 2: Check for conflicts
        conflicts = self.detect_conflicts(dependencies, context.existing_patterns)
        
        # Step 3: Resolve conflicts first
        for conflict in conflicts:
            resolution = self.resolve_conflict(conflict, context)
            plan.add_conflict_resolution(resolution)
        
        # Step 4: Order dependencies by precedence
        ordered_deps = self.order_dependencies(dependencies)
        
        # Step 5: Create application plan
        for dep in ordered_deps:
            if not context.has_pattern(dep):
                plan.add_dependency_application(dep)
        
        # Step 6: Add target pattern
        plan.add_pattern_application(target_pattern)
        
        return plan
```

### Resolution Strategies

#### 1. Automatic Resolution
```yaml
automatic_resolution:
  conditions:
    - no_breaking_changes: true
    - confidence_level: high
    - user_consent: "pre_approved"
  
  actions:
    - apply_required_dependencies
    - resolve_soft_conflicts
    - upgrade_compatible_patterns
```

#### 2. Interactive Resolution
```yaml
interactive_resolution:
  conditions:
    - breaking_changes: true
    - confidence_level: medium
    - user_consent: required
  
  actions:
    - present_options_to_user
    - explain_implications
    - get_explicit_confirmation
    - apply_user_choices
```

#### 3. Manual Resolution
```yaml
manual_resolution:
  conditions:
    - complex_conflicts: true
    - custom_requirements: true
    - expert_user: true
  
  actions:
    - provide_detailed_analysis
    - offer_multiple_resolution_paths

## Context-Aware Dependency Management

### Context Influence on Dependencies

#### Small Team Context
```yaml
small_team_adjustments:
  simplify_dependencies:
    - prefer: "all-in-one-patterns"
    - avoid: "complex-multi-pattern-solutions"
    - auto_apply: "sensible-defaults"
  
  dependency_preferences:
    - pattern: "container-deployment"
      alternative: "simple-deployment"
      reason: "Reduced operational complexity for small teams"
```

#### Enterprise Context
```yaml
enterprise_adjustments:
  enhance_dependencies:
    - require: "audit-logging"
    - require: "compliance-patterns"
    - prefer: "enterprise-integrations"
  
  security_upgrades:
    - auto_upgrade: "basic-security"
    - to: "enterprise-security"
    - reason: "Enterprise security requirements"
```

#### Legacy Integration Context
```yaml
legacy_adjustments:
  compatibility_mode:
    - maintain: "existing-patterns"
    - gradual_upgrade: true
    - backward_compatibility: required
  
  migration_support:
    - provide: "migration-patterns"
    - preserve: "existing-functionality"
    - test: "integration-points"
```

## Pattern Composition Rules

### Composition Strategies

#### 1. Layered Composition
**Pattern Stack**: Foundation → Infrastructure → Application → Features
```yaml
composition_layers:
  foundation:
    - basic-project-structure
    - version-control
    - basic-security
  
  infrastructure:
    - deployment-pattern
    - database-pattern
    - networking-pattern
  
  application:
    - architecture-pattern
    - authentication-pattern
    - api-pattern
  
  features:
    - pwa-pattern
    - monitoring-pattern
    - analytics-pattern
```

#### 2. Feature Composition
**Related Features**: Group patterns that work together
```yaml
feature_groups:
  authentication_suite:
    core: "advanced-authentication"
    enhancements:
      - "multi-factor-auth"
      - "sso-integration"
      - "session-security"
  
  pwa_suite:
    core: "progressive-web-app"
    enhancements:
      - "offline-capability"
      - "push-notifications"
      - "app-store-deployment"
```

### Composition Validation

#### 1. Compatibility Matrix
```yaml
compatibility_matrix:
  "progressive-web-app":
    compatible:
      - "modern-web-stack"
      - "advanced-authentication"
      - "container-deployment"
    incompatible:
      - "server-side-rendering"  # With specific configurations
    requires_config:
      - "reverse-proxy-setup"   # Needs PWA-aware configuration
```

#### 2. Performance Impact Analysis
```yaml
performance_analysis:
  pattern_combinations:
    "advanced-auth + pwa + container":
      memory_impact: "medium"
      startup_time: "increased"
      runtime_performance: "minimal"
      recommendations:
        - "implement-lazy-loading"
        - "optimize-container-startup"
```

## Resolution Plan Generation

### Plan Structure
```yaml
resolution_plan:
  id: "auth-enhancement-plan-001"
  target_pattern: "advanced-authentication"
  application_mode: "enhancement"
  
  context_summary:
    project_type: "existing_react_app"
    team_size: "small"
    security_requirements: "high"
    current_auth: "basic-password"
  
  phases:
    - phase: "preparation"
      duration: "30 minutes"
      actions:
        - backup_current_implementation
        - document_existing_auth_flow
        - validate_https_setup
    
    - phase: "dependency_resolution"
      duration: "1 hour"
      actions:
        - apply_pattern: "session-management"
          reason: "Required for secure token handling"
        - upgrade_pattern: "basic-https"
          to: "production-https"
          reason: "Enhanced security for authentication"
    
    - phase: "pattern_application"
      duration: "4-6 hours"
      actions:
        - apply_pattern: "advanced-authentication"
          configuration:
            enable_webauthn: true
            enable_sso: false  # Based on small team context
            mfa_required: true # Based on high security requirement
    
    - phase: "validation"
      duration: "1 hour"
      actions:
        - test_authentication_flows
        - validate_security_headers
        - check_pattern_completion
  
  rollback_plan:

    - validate_original_functionality
  
  success_criteria:
    - all_tests_passing
    - security_audit_clean

```

### Plan Customization

#### Context-Based Adjustments
```python
def customize_plan(base_plan: ResolutionPlan, context: ProjectContext) -> ResolutionPlan:
    customized_plan = base_plan.copy()
    
    # Adjust for team size
    if context.team_size == "small":
        customized_plan.simplify_configuration()
        customized_plan.add_automation_steps()
        customized_plan.reduce_complexity()
    
    # Adjust for timeline
    if context.timeline == "urgent":
        customized_plan.parallel_execution = True
        customized_plan.skip_optional_steps()
        customized_plan.use_quick_defaults()
    
    # Adjust for expertise
    if context.expertise == "junior":
        customized_plan.add_detailed_explanations()
        customized_plan.include_learning_resources()
        customized_plan.add_validation_steps()
    
    return customized_plan
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Dependency Resolution Failures

#### 1. Circular Dependencies
```yaml
circular_dependency_handling:
  detection: "graph_analysis"
  resolution_strategies:
    - break_optional_dependencies
    - suggest_alternative_patterns
    - provide_manual_override
  
  example:
    patterns: ["pattern-a", "pattern-b", "pattern-c"]
    cycle: "a->b->c->a"
    resolution: "make_b_c_dependency_optional"
```

#### 2. Unresolvable Conflicts
```yaml
conflict_escalation:
  strategies:
    - suggest_alternative_patterns
    - propose_custom_integration
    - expert_consultation_mode
    - manual_resolution_guidance
  
  fallback:
    - document_conflict
    - provide_workaround_options
    - schedule_future_resolution
```

### Recovery Mechanisms

#### 1. Pattern Rollback
```yaml
rollback_capabilities:
  automatic_rollback:
    triggers:
      - pattern_application_failure
      - validation_failure
      - user_abort_request
  
  rollback_scope:
    - pattern_specific: "undo_single_pattern"
    - dependency_chain: "undo_entire_chain"
    - selective: "user_choose_scope"
```

#### 2. Partial Application Recovery
```yaml
partial_recovery:
  scenarios:
    - some_dependencies_applied
    - pattern_partially_configured
    - conflicts_partially_resolved
  
  recovery_options:
    - complete_application
    - rollback_to_stable_state
    - fix_forward_approach
```

This dependency system ensures that patterns can be applied reliably in any context while maintaining system coherence and providing clear resolution paths for conflicts. The context-aware nature means that the same pattern can be applied differently based on project needs, team size, and technical requirements.
